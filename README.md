# Analyzing and Predicting Wildfires in Colorado's US Forests

## PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in core data science and geographic information systems (GIS) principles and skills. The project heavily uses Python, a programming language, along with select Python libraries, and ArcGIS Pro, a popular GIS software platform. 

A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file is included with Python code, as well as a GIS_SUPPLEMENT.doc file, which demonstrates some (but not all) of the steps taken to acquire and manipulate the geospatial data used in this project. In addition, numerous maps, graphs, tables and charts have been created to best visualize and understand the data.

## TOPIC
The project explores if wildfires can be predicted in US Forests in Colorado.
